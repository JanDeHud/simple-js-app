## About
This is a pokemon app that uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The app loads data from an external app. The details of the API are shown as data points in detail by clicking on a pokemon name. The pokemon details appear through a modal. The modal has a close [x] and is separated into a title (pokemon name) and a body (pokemon character). The search field shown in the navigation bar as well as the two buttons below the table have not yet integrated any function.
